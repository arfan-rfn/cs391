# Solar Simulation

## Learning Objective

The Goal of this assignment is to design a class hierarchy to solve a problem, implement that hierarchy, use polymorphism, and use multi-dimensional arrays and/or lists.

## Our Solar System
Our [Solar System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System) is made with a [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun) at the middle and several [planets](https://www.space.com/16080-solar-system-planets.html) moving around the [Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun). And some planets can have it's won [Natural Satellite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_satellite). These Natural satellite also moving around the planet in circle. In this project you will be creating a simple simulation of our solar system.

For this assignment, the solar system you will be implementing will consist of a number of columns and rows. The planets will move around this solar. To make the problem more interesting each of the planet can have 0 to 2 natural satellite. Each satellite will move with the parent planet around the sun. And the satellite should also can move around the parent planet. Though the circular movement of the planets and satellite is not perfectly circular. For the seek of simplicity we will create our simulation thinking of the planets move in perfect circular.

However this project is small part of your final project. Next two project will be build up on top of this. From the next project as soon as we introduce the [JavaFX](https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/overview/jfxpub-overview.htm), you will create the simulation in the [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).

## The Assignment
This is a three-week assignment. Your main program, which must be named ```SolarMain.java``` will need to accept the name of an input file on the command line. The input file will contain all of the simulation initialization settings and the commands to simulate. Here is an example input file.

```
CREATE SOLAR
PRINT
ADD EARTH 2 anti-clock
PRINT
MOVE
PRINT
```
Note that the commands should be case-insensitive. In other words, "print", "PRINT", and "Print" are all equivalent in the input file. Here is the output for the example:

```

The following are the types of specific Planets and satellite that can be created:

```
PLANETS         SATELLITE     
-------         -----------         
Earth           Moon         
Mars            Titan            
Jupiter         Triton        
Saturn          Phobos         
Uranus          Deimos         
Neptune         Miranda         
```
For this project, planets will be represented with ascii characters. Use the lower case version of the first letter of the Planets name. For "Earth" use ``` E ```, for "Mars" use ``` M ```,etc. 

To add the satellite add a single ```"``` to any side of the planet. 

### IMPORTANT thing to know!
Each planets without any satellite will contain a empty space in both side, and the first satellite will be represent with a single colon ```'``` will fill any of the white space and double single ```"``` for the second satellite. Each planet is printed inside ```|here|``` the double bar

0 satellite | ``` E ``` | [Space before and after E char] 

1 satellite | ```E'```| or |```'E ``` | [single ```'``` can be any side and the space will be removed from it]

2 satellite |```"E'```| or |```'E"``` | [No white space to any side, and ```"``` will be added to the other side, where the single ```space``` have ]


## Commands that need to be implemented
CREATE SOLAR *, ADD *, SATELLITE *, PRINT, MOVE *
[replace the ```*``` with additional commend]

### CREATE SOLAR:
Crate a grid of 21 x 21 with a 3 radius sun (3x3) at the middle. The size of grid will be always 21x21 and the size of the sun will be always 3x3 at the center. If there have any command is given before the ```CREATE SOLAR``` command that will will simply be ignored. This part is very strait forward. And should be easy.

## ADD <PLANET\> <(int) radius> <clock/anti-clock\>
``` 
Example USE: ADD MARS 2 clock
```
It draw the mars 2 dot far from the sun, you can choose any random position. And it will move clock wise when the ```MOVE``` command is given. It should look like ```< M >```

Adding a planet to the grid based on the radius from sun. Remember the radius from edge of the sun, not from center single point of the center. An easy way to say there must be a ```number of radius``` grid gap between the sun and the planet. Max number of radius is ```radius â‰¤ 6``` and based on the third argument the planet will move clock or anti-clock wise around the sun. Remember to add ```<space>``` or ```<'>``` or ```<">``` based on the number of satellite. 

Each of the planet will take 3 char long space in the grid. If one planet is placed in two radius route then the before and after radius can't be added other planet. In other way If a planet is added on 2nd radius you can't add any other planed on 0th to 4th radius. Your solar object must track this situation. Is sill some command is given to add a new planet near another planet then the comment will be ignored. That being said 

``` 
ADD MARS 2 clock
ADD EARTH 1 anti-clock
ADD NEPTUNE 4 clock
```
This two command will be ignored. This three command will only add Mars to the grid. Nothing else.
``` 
ADD EARTH 1 anti-clock
ADD NEPTUNE 3 clock
```

## SATELLITE <PLANET\>
``` 
Example USE: SATELLITE MARS
```
With a first satellite command to Mars just add a single satellite to the Mars planet. You can add them to any side of the planet. Just replace the ```<space>``` with a single ```<'>```. After this command Mars planet should look like ```< M'>```
``` 
Example USE: SATELLITE MARS
```
When the Satellite command is given for a same planet you need to replace other space with ```<">``` this time. After the second command the Mars planet should look like ```<"M'>``` this. Remember to replace the other ```<space>```, don't replace the single satellite mark.

## MOVE 
``` 
Example USE: MOVE
```
Move all the planets 1 grid clock wise or anti-clock wise based on the planet argument on it's creation. Here is all possible route for the moves, the number represent

## MOVE <PLANET\>

if the type is a Planet type and the solar contains this planet then only move this planet. rest of the planet will be remain in the same place. 

## MOVE SATELLITE <PLANET\>

If the type is a satellite type then the planet will be remain in the same place but all the planet satellite position will be change. for example, 
```
CREATE SOLAR
ADD EARTH 2 anti-clock
ADD MARS 3 clock
ADD MARS 6 clock
SATELLITE MARS
SATELLITE EARTH
SATELLITE MARS
PRINT
MOVE SATELLITE EARTH
MOVE SATELLITE MARS
PRINT

## Error handling
All of the inputs will be correctly formed for this assignment.

## Milestones
While we do not require you to follow this objective list, we highly recommend you tackle the tasks in this order. There will also be test cases you can use to see if you are on the right track for each milestone.

1 Read the writeup at least one time through, taking notes on a separate piece of paper on the important aspects.

2 Think and draw your Planet class hierarchy. This may take multiple iterations. Think about a class hierarchy that makes sense and reduces code duplication.

3 Write your SolarMain.java file which reads in a file of commands and calls the appropriate classes. This file should not be overly long or complex. Instead of calling the methods you have not written yet, put in "dummy" print statements. For example if MOVE [type] is called, just have SolarMain.java print out "MOVE earth called".

4	Write your SolarSystem.java file which will keep track of your grid of Planet. Presumably, this file will hold the functionality for the PRINT command. Write this print command and test that it prints off empty grids of the correct size.

5	Go through multiple test cases in the PublicTestCases folder. Make sure that you understand why the output performs as it does. If you don't understand, post on piazza. While we hope this is not the case, It is also possible that there are some errors in the test case outputs. Many of the test cases were created new to be able to test smaller parts of the assignment.

6	Write the barebones skeleton of your Planet classes. At the very least you should be able to create each planet type.

7	Write the necessary code for CREATE. You should now be testing your code with every incremental change. With CREATE, you can now look at the different test cases we have provided to ensure you are placing planet correctly after having been created.

8	MOVE: specifically MOVE for planet, then for Satellite. After MOVE for each planet type, compare your output to the test cases we have provided that moves those specific planet types. Catching bugs earlier rather than later will make your life much easier. Also we recommend that you implement the general MOVE, before moving on to the specific types like MOVE [type], and MOVE [Planet]. It is imperative to your success that you test each successive change as you write your code.

9	Reproduce: follow a similar pattern as you did for the MOVE command in step 7.

10	Tie together any loose ends. This should include a full review of your code to see if you can simplify anything. It is recommended that you commit and push before reviewing/changing your code in case you break anything.

## Grading Criteria
Half of the project grade will be correctness. For this assignment, there will be some private test cases to test your code


## Decomposition
* Points will be taken off for copy, pasted, and edited code that should have been encapsulated in a method.

* Should carefully select data structures that implement the required functionality.

* Your program should contain 10 or less java files. All of the Java files should be <350 lines of code.

* Each method should be less than 30 lines. This INCLUDES comments, but not the method header. It is easier to read a function if it can all fit on one screen.

* Make things as simple as possible.

    * Don't use lambda functions or other features in non-standard ways.
    * Reduce the amount of conditional nesting as much as possible.
* Declare collection variables using interface types.

* Your code should be decomposed well. main should be a good summary of your program and no method should be overly long or trivial. Your methods should not be chained. Do NOT have main just call one method that does everything.

* Redundancy is a grading focus; some tasks are similar in behavior or based off of other tasks. You should avoid repeated logic as much as possible.

Code Clarity

* YOU should be able to read, understand, and explain your own code to someone else a couple days after you wrote it.

    * No magic numbers
    * No methods written to just get the test cases to work
* There needs to be a balance between no comments in the body of the methods and a comment for every line in the program. Either extreme will result in points off.

* The file header should include instructions on how someone would use this program. To use the program, one would need to know the input file format.

* Use meaningful variable names. Loop iterators can be simple (i for integers, s for strings, n for numbers, etc.).

* We will be modeling some of the issues we are seeing with code.

* We will ask permission to show clear code examples.

The coding style in terms of spacing, etc. should be done automatically every time you save in Eclipse. As long as you stick with those defaults, the syntax style should be fine. At workplaces the style requirements can be extensive. In this class, we have the following requirements:

1. No lines should be longer than 80 characters line.
2. Do not mix tabs and spaces. Use spaces consistently.
3. The left curly brace should start on the same line as the loop or conditional.
